# Terminal Russian Roulette

A simple command-line game written in Python. I created this project to practice coding logic and terminal interaction on Ubuntu (WSL).

## Features

- ASCII art gun
- Suspenseful time delays using the time library
- Screen clearing for a clean interface
- A 1/6 chance of terminating the process

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Run the game in your terminal:

```bash
python3 russian_roulete.py
